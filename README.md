# Chicago Police Incidents Data

## What is this?

This is a living repository of public data about Chicagoâ€™s police officers and their interactions with the public, maintained by the Invisible Institute and the ChiHackNight community. The datasets stores in this repository describe  deal with several different forms of data covering shootings, use of force, complaints of misconduct and their investigations. Most was released in response to FOIA requests by the Invisible Institute and its partners.

This repository also serves as a hub to facilitate the Chicago community's efforts to use these data to serve as a common body of evidence to better understand the activities of the Chicago Police Department.

Be sure to look into the `context_data` folder as its contents will help you to understand the full picture. It includes awards, commendations, promotions, crisis intervention trainings, and demographic details for all officers, and their unit assignments over time. More specific details about the transactional datasets here are detailed at the end.

## Where did it come from?

The original data and documents are all sourced directly from the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), or the City of Chicago. The raw files were released pursuant to [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) requests made by the Invisible Institute and its partners. Scraped data from the [IPRA data portal](http://portal.iprachicago.org/) is also included.
